1A______ma________zing grace! How   sweet the  sound!
2'Twas  grace     that taught my    heart to   fear,
3The    Lord      has  pro____mised good  to   me,
4Thro'  ma________ny   dan____gers, toils and  snares
5When   we've     been there  ten   thou__sand years,

.       Bm         E           A       A7
1That   saved a    wretch like me!
2And    grace my   fears  re___lieved.
3His    Word  my   hope   se___cures.
4I      have  al___rea____dy   come.
5Bright shi___ning as     the  sun,

.      D           D7           G           D     
1I     once  was   lost,   but  now   am    found;
2How   pre___cious did     that grace ap____pear,
3He    will  my    shield  and  por___tion  be
4'Tis  grace that  brought me   safe  thus  far,
5We've no    less  days    to   sing  God's praise,

.     Bm          A        G      D 
1Was  blind, but  now   I  see.
2The  hour   I    first be_lieved.
3As   long   as   life  en_dures.
4And  grace  will lead  me home.
5Than when   we   first be_gun.
