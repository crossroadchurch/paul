<verse id="Verse 1">
"Great is Thy faithfulness", O God my Father.
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,
As Thou hast been Thou forever shall be.
</verse>
<verse id="Chorus">
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see!
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is Thy faithfulness", Lord, unto me!
</verse>
<verse id="Verse 2">
Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above,
Join with all nature in manifold witness,
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.
</verse>
<verse id="Chorus">
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see!
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is Thy faithfulness", Lord, unto me!
</verse>
<verse id="Verse 3">
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
</verse>
<verse id="Chorus">
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see!
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided -
"Great is Thy faithfulness", Lord, unto me!
