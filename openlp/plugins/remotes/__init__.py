"""
The :mod:`remotes` plugin allows OpenLP to be controlled from another machine
over a network connection.

Routes:

``/``
    Go to the web interface.

``/files/{filename}``
    Serve a static file.

``/api/poll``
    Poll to see if there are any changes. Returns a JSON-encoded dict of
    any changes that occurred::

        {"results": {"type": "controller"}}

    Or, if there were no results, False::

        {"results": False}

``/api/controller/{live|preview}/{action}``
    Perform ``{action}`` on the live or preview controller. Valid actions
    are:

    ``next``
        Load the next slide.

    ``previous``
        Load the previous slide.

    ``jump``
        Jump to a specific slide. Requires an id return in a JSON-encoded
        dict like so::

            {"request": {"id": 1}}

    ``first``
        Load the first slide.

    ``last``
        Load the last slide.

    ``text``
        Request the text of the current slide.

``/api/service/{action}``
    Perform ``{action}`` on the service manager (e.g. go live). Data is
    passed as a json-encoded ``data`` parameter. Valid actions are:

    ``next``
        Load the next item in the service.

    ``previous``
        Load the previews item in the service.

    ``jump``
        Jump to a specific item in the service. Requires an id returned in
        a JSON-encoded dict like so::

            {"request": {"id": 1}}

    ``list``
        Request a list of items in the service.
